# Custom styles for Club System

**Em Development** manages an instalation of their **Club System** web application for **Takapuna Ski Club (TSC)**.  This is customized for TSC via configuration parameters, two images and one stylesheet.

## Installation

Em Development deploys the following to our managed instalation of Club System;

- `takapuna.css`
- `leftimage.jpg`
- `rightimage.jpg`

## Maintenance

TSC can then deploy changes by merging changes into `styles.css` in the `master` branch.  Changes to images still need to be done by Em Dev.
